# Getting started
We distinguish between (simple) ad hoc ("infrastructureless") distance tracking and a full positioning setup. Please refer to the correct documentation based on your application needs or the infrastructure/kit you have available. For entry-level users, it is easyer to get started with simple distance tracking. All hardware can be reused if you later switch to position tracking.

::: tip
  You need RTLS hardware to get started. You can purchase these from us or other vendors. (we provide interoperability, for example with Decawave's DWM1001)

## Ad hoc distance tracking
An ad hoc system requires less hardware (only tags). It will only the distances between each of these tags. Thus no positions are calculated. (You can however get - less accurate - relative position estimates)
Follow these steps to get started:
1. [Getting Started Adhoc](/install/adhoc_getting_started.html)
2. [Tips & Tricks](install/adhoc_tips.html)

## (Full) Position tracking
To track positions, a combination of anchor and tag hardware devices is needed. Follow these steps to get started:
1. [Getting Started](/install/getting_started.html)
2. [First localization](/install/firststeps.html)
3. [Anchor Placement](/install/anchor_placement.html)
