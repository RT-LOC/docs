# Getting started
We distinguish between autoposition RTLS and a full high-precision positioning setup. Please refer to the correct documentation based on your application needs or the infrastructure/kit you have available. For entry-level users, it is easyer to get started using autopositioning of the anchors. All hardware can be reused if you later switch to the professional system.

There is also the option only do (ad hoc) distance tracking, when you only need distances between a set of tags (no anchors). Read more about this [here](/install/adhoc_getting_started.html).

::: tip
  You need RTLS hardware to get started. You can purchase these from us or other vendors. (we provide interoperability, for example with Decawave's DWM1001)

## RTLS introduction (autoposition)
As an introduction to (ultra-wideband) RTLS, we will start with a simple system where anchors are autopositioned. Then tag positions are tracked and read out over BLE.

2. [Tips & Tricks](install/adhoc_tips.html)

## Pro RTLS (full position tracking)
To track positions, a combination of anchor and tag hardware devices is needed. Follow these steps to get started:

3. [Anchor Placement](/install/anchor_placement.html)
