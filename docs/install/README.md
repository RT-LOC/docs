# Deployment
On this page you can find more information on some good (and bad) practices when you deploy a system. When you want to set up a high-end RTLS, you should keep a couple of simple rules in mind.

## Basic rules
 1. **Strategically place your anchors.**
 If you want accurate results, it's best that you have measurements from different sides of the target. Ideally you should try to have anchors in a rectangle around the position you're measuring.
 Also make sure that every possible point in space you want to locate has at least 4 anchors with clear line of sight (LOS) on it.

 2. **Calibrate your system.**

 3. **Aim your antennas**.
 For more information, see below (x.).

 4. **TODO.**

## Antennas
A crucial step in the deployment is to make sure that the antennas are well placed. Keep in mind that every antenna has some directionality, and works better in certain directions.
If you want good coverage in a certain area, it's best to point the antenna so that it has the highest gain in the direction of the area of interest.

As already mentioned above, also make sure that the area around the antenna is clear. Make sure the antenna has a 'clear' sight. Also avoid having metal structures too close to the antenna.
