# Hardware

We support different UWB hardware, self-made as well as from other vendors. Each board has it's own firmware(s), which can be easily installed and updated.

## Interfaces
There are plenty of ways to interface with our hardware. Here you can find a list of all supported interfaces:
 - [BLE](hw_interface_ble.html)
 - [CAN](hw_interface_can.html)
 - [USB](hw_interface_usb.html)
 - [UART](hw_interface_uart.html)
 - [SPI](hw_interface_spi.html)
 - I2C
 - (Sniffer)

## Flashing the Boards

Firmware can be updated over-the-air from our RTLS Manager software. The latest firmwares can also be searched and flashed over USB from our RTLOC app.

### Developers
If one of the built-in firmware update methods are not enough for you and you want to experiment into the smallest detail with the hardware, you'll find help here to get you going.
You will get help setting up the complete toolchain and some guidance in using the scripts.
