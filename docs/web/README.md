# Web app

When you create a project using our software, a cloud / web portal will **automatically be set up** for you. To view your RTLS data, [register a RTLOC cloud account](https://app.rtloc.com/register). If your account is not linked to any projects, you will by default see demo projects with demo data.

The portal app can provide basic data debugging and visualization. It is however mainly a demonstration of how the RTLS data can be integrated into a (web) application.
