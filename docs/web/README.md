# Web app

When you create a project using our software, a cloud / web portal will **automatically be set up** for you. To view your RTLS data, [register a RTLOC cloud account](https://cloud.rtloc.com/register). If your account is not linked to any projects, you will by default see demo projects with demo data.

## Data upload
If however you don't want data to be transmitted outside of your local premises, you can easily disable it in our software. Select which data can be uploaded or disable all data upload.

> :hammer: More documentation on our web interface coming soon!
