# Introduction

This view allows you to set up a Bluetooth connection to an RTLS node (tag or anchor). This way you can read out device-specific information, read out positions or even send commands (e.g. initiating autopositioning)

## Connect
Connect to a bluetooth device using the icon in the toolbar, or the button on the Bluetooth view.
