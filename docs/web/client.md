# Clients, projects and setups

A **Client** is an organization and has multiple Users who have access to it. These **Users** are the employees that are granted access to the RTLOC platform. A Client can contain multiple **Projects**. A Project can have it's own floor configuration, assets (people and devices) and collected positioning/sensor data. Different Projects can be active (location tracking) at the same time. 

In the web app one client and one project at a time is selected. You can switch between projects from the project selection button:

This button might not be visible when there is only one Project within the Client.
