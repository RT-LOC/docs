# Clients, projects and setups

A **client** is an organization and has multiple users who have access to it. A client can have multiple (RTLS) **projects**, each with their own license, own floor configuration and positioning/sensor data. Different projects can be active (location tracking) at the same time. A project can be moveable (for example for different events) and can therefor contain multiple **setups** (only one project setup is active at a time).

In the web app one client and one project at a time is selected. You can switch between projects from the project selection button:

Usually you will have one setup in your project (for a fixed installation). Setup selection is only visible once a second setup has been created.
