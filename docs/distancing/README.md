# Distancing setup

Follow this guide if you want to create a smart mesh between tags, and do not need exact XYZ positions. In this mesh of tags you can track the **distance** between tags, exchange messages (e.g. about distance breach events) and collect sensor data.

If instead you also need to know the position of your objects, you'll need a [Positioning system](/positioning). This will always involve anchors that are hung around the field of interest. The precise positions of these anchors are fixed and need to be known.
