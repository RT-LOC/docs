# 2. Configuration

The first steps made in part 1 are enough to get data (distances, positions, status) from your devices. If this (raw) data is all you need, you do not need additional configuration.
Additional configuration our Desktop app allows for:
- Better visualization
- Additional processing (zones, events, etc)

## Map configuration

In the floorplan screen you can configure basic viewer settings:
1. Axis orientation
2. Upload floorplan: the floorplan image
3. Scale image: floorplan image size
4. Position image: translate and rotate the floorplan. If you have your anchor positions from the first step, you can match them here with the floorplan.
