# What's Next
There's a lot more to discover in the web portal. You can for example check out the [sensor data from the tags](/web/ble_visualise.html#sensor-data), configure parameters, set up an MQTT connection to get data to your own system and more.

## Features
For a more detailed guide on how to use the portal and all of its features, please refer to the [portal system guide](/web/ble_introduction).

## Build your own app
You can connect your own app to the device BLE interface and use the RTLS data. Check out the [BLE API details](/api/api_ble) for BLE development.

It is also possible to access a real-time stream of position- and sensor data. We provide data in binary and JSON format, over UDP, TCP, websocket or MQTT. To do this, you will need a license for our professional setup. This also includes professional UWB debugging tools on the desktop.

## Pro Positioning
We designed the Basic Positioning system for hobbyists, DIY'ers and companies who are new to RTLS. If you are in for (a whole lot) more, feel free to read on the [Pro/full Positioning](positioning_getting_started) system or send us a message for more information.
