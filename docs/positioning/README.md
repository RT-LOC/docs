# Getting started

In order to start tracking, you will need hardware nodes such as anchors and tags. You can purchase them from us or even from other vendors. We support a range of hardware, including Decawave's DWM1001 based boards.
Before we can get started, you need to know which setup type you need. For full positioning performance, our [Professional / full setup](/positioning/positioning_getting_started.html) is used. This is the typical RTLS deployment scenario.

Even without any hardware you can check out our API. You can do this in the RTManager app by [setting up a replay](/positioning/trying_demo_replays.html).


<!-- ### Basic Positioning
If you are new to RTLS, we advise you to start with our `Basic Positioning` solution. It will allow you to set up a system in no-time. You can configure the system and read out the data in a web browser via a BLE connection.
::: warning
If you bought the starter kit, you can jump immediately to the dedicated [getting started](/getstarted/basic_positioning_getting_started.html#getting-started) section
:::

::: tip
Note that all hardware can be reused if you later decide to upgrade to a [Pro Positioning](/positioning/positioning_getting_started.html) setup.
:::  -->

<!-- ## Pro Positioning
In case you have some more experience already, the best results can be achieved with the `Pro Positioning` type of setup. This setup takes you above and beyond what seems to be possible with an RTLS system.  -->

Our full RTLS system features very accurate position tracking as well as efficient communication over UWB. It features extensive APIs to interact with all data.
