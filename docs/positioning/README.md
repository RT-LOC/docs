# Getting started
In order to start tracking, you will need hardware nodes such as anchors and tags. You can purchase them from us or even from other vendors. We support a range of hardware, including Decawave's DWM1001 based boards.
Before we can get started, you need to know which setup type you need. For full positioning performance, our [Professional / full setup](/positioning/pro_positioning_getting_started.html) is used. This is the typical RTLS deployment scenario.

Even without any hardware you can check out our API. You can do this in the RTManager app by [setting up a replay](/positioning/trying_demo_replays.html).


<!-- ### Basic Positioning
If you are new to RTLS, we advise you to start with our `Basic Positioning` solution. It will allow you to set up a system in no-time. You can configure the system and read out the data in a web browser via a BLE connection.
::: warning
If you bought the starter kit, you can jump immediately to the dedicated [getting started](/getstarted/basic_positioning_getting_started.html#getting-started) section
:::

::: tip
Note that all hardware can be reused if you later decide to upgrade to a [Pro Positioning](/getstarted/pro_positioning_getting_started.html) setup.

## Pro Positioning
In case you have some more experience already, the best results can be achieved with the `Pro Positioning` type of setup. This setup takes you above and beyond what seems to be possible with an RTLS system. It features the most advanced configuration system so that the system can be tweaked to perfection for every single use case. It features extensive APIs to interact with all data.
