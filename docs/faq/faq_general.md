## What do I need to get started?
You will need at least 3 anchors, 1 tag and a PC and 1 ethernet cables. This will already give you the possibility to obtain accurate positions in a small setup.

## Why would you use listeners?
While our system doesn’t require any listeners, we do recommend the use of it, as it will simplify the installation and add extra features and layers of redundancy.
Adding a listener means no other anchors have to be cabled. 

## What kind of computer do I need?
Any PC with windows 7 or later will do.
You can also run our daemon software on e.g. a NUC pc.
The visualization software runs on windows 7, 8, 10, iOS, macOS, linux, ...

## How reliable is your system? 
We've spent a lot of time on making our system as reliable as physically possible.
We made sure every single element in the system can be made 100% redundant. 
If the power of a specific PC or anchor fails, the system will keep running seamlessly as if nothing happened.

## Do I need a master anchor?
In most existing RTLS systems, you will need a master anchor that is the ‘boss’ of the system. We believe a master anchor is just another possible single-point-of-failure and should be avoided. That’s why we just don’t have any master anchor, as in fact all the anchors in the system are equally important.

## How many cables do I need?
Note that every anchor that is cabled, can send tasks to any other anchor.

## How many position updates can you offer?
This depends on other parameters, mainly: how many devices will be used. Our system is able to go up to 1500 positional updates per second with 4 anchors, or 1.000 updates with 16 anchors.
This means we calculate 16.000 distances per second, which is close to the physical limit of what is possible.

## Do I need to measure anything when setting up the system?
No, we can auto-range and auto-position the anchors via the software.
However, when you want to achieve a higher accuracy, it is recommended to submit accurate anchor positions. You can measure these positions very precisely using a total station.

## Do I need to calibrate the system?
All hardware is delivered pre-calibrated. In most cases this will give you an accuracy that is more than sufficient.  If you want to get up to the last centimeter in all circumstances, you can calibrate your system via one of our two calibration interfaces.
