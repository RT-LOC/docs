# Getting started
In order to get started, you will need hardware nodes such as anchors and tags. You can purchase them from us or even from other vendors. We support a range of hardware, including Decawaves DWM1001 based boards.
Before we can get started, you need to know which setup type you need. We offer 3 setup types:
 - [Basic Positioning](/getstarted/basic_positioning_getting_started.html) (RTLS introduction kit)
 - [Pro Positioning](/getstarted/pro_positioning_getting_started.html) (Pro RTLS kit)
 - [Distance Tracking](/getstarted/distance_tracking_getting_started.html)
 
 Please refer to the correct documentation based on your application needs or the infrastructure/kit you have available.

 ## Distance Tracking
If you only need the distances between moving objects and possibly other sensor data from those objects, you want to go for the `Distance Tracking` solution.

When you also need to know the position of your objects, you'll need a Positioning system. This will always involve anchors that are hung around the field of intrest. The precise positions of these anchors are fixed and need to be known.

## Basic Positioning
If you are new to RTLS, we advise you to start with our `Basic Positioning` solution. It will allow you to set up a system in no-time. You can configure the system and read out the data in a web browser via a BLE connection.
::: warning
If you bought the starterskit, you can jump immediately to the dedicated [getting started](/getstarted/basic_positioning_getting_started.html#getting-started) section

::: tip
Note that all hardware can be reused if you later decide to upgrade to a [Pro Positioning](/getstarted/pro_positioning_getting_started.html) setup.
::: 

## Pro Positioning
In case you have some more experience already, the best results can be achieved with the `Pro Positioning` type of setup. This setup takes you above and beyond what seems to be possible with an RTLS system. It features the most advanced configuration system so that the system can be tweaked to perfection for every single use case. It features extensive APIs to interact with all data.
