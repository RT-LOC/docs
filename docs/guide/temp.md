## Interfacing
*cxRTLS* contains multiple servers that you can interface with. If you need data raw and quick, you can use the UDP server.
If you need more control, use the TCP server.
All interfacing is done with the RTLOC binary protocol that you can find [here](https://www.rtloc.com/docs/private/Learn/Protocol/).
