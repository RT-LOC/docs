# System Guide
This page contains a list of guides that will help you to understand and use the RTLOC software.

At RTLOC, we :heart:_speed_ & _extreme performance_. That's why around the heart of our product, we built the blazing-fast PC application **cxRTLS**.
This software can be used to configure, manage and analyze the RTLS system into the smallest detail.

On top of the PC software, we also offer a complete web-based portal called **cxPortal**. This allows to have all your data available on any modern device.

* [Web portal](/web/) - View all RTLS data and statistics anywhere, from within the browser.
* [Hardware](/hardware/) - Interface with our hardware and more.
