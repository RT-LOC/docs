At RTLOC, we :heart:_speed_ & _extreme performance_. That's why around the heart of our product, we built the blazing-fast PC application **cxRTLS**.
This software can be used to configure, manage and analyze the RTLS system into the smallest detail.

On top of the PC software, we also offer a complete web-based portal called **cxPortal**. This allows to have all your data available on any modern device.
