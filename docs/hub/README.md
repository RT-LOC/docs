# RTHub
The RTHub application is the starting point when it comes to our PC software suite. It provides an easy way to install, update and open our different apps. It can also download different firmwares and flash them onto devices. You can download the latest version at [https://cloud.rtloc.com/download](https://cloud.rtloc.com/download). 

> :hammer: Currently this app is available for windows only. It will be available for linux and MAC soon as well!
